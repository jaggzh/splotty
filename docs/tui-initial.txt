Header area:
  Global hotkeys:
    (q) requires confirmation in status area (y)
    Alt-d allows device selection. For simplicity right now:
      Displays in status area:
        f"{' '.join(valid_devs)} [Editable field where user types dev themselves]
        *If we can, up and down arrow fills out from prev/next valid_dev, overwriting current entry.
    Other than device name, baud and serial settings are specified only via cli for now

User can tab between tree area and other areas.
Up and down keys move through tree.
l expands one level
L expands tree
h collapses one level
H ... tree
j Move down (select next item in visible items in tree)
J Relocates child down (this will reparent to keep UI simple)
alt-j (\033j) REPARENTS down (skipping leafs)
k Move up (select prev)
K Relocates child up
alt-k (\033j) REPARENTS up (skipping leafs)
- Deletes an entire tree (with confirmation)

When ON a tree, the help line displays:
[Tab] [Add: (a)Child (o)Sibling] (Enter)Edit

What these mean:
(a)Add-Child   -- Inserts branch as child to current item (skips leaves). Item given default unique 'New-#' name
(o)Add-Sibling -- Inserts branch as sibling below current element (skips leaves)
(Enter)Edit    -- Edit name of item
(M)onitor      -- Monitors (Displays "Monitoring ({n}s...)" in status)

On the right side is a list of fields.
hj moves up and down through them.
Enter adds it to the current selected tree item directly below current selected item (if last leaf in tree, adds as next sibling)
Moving up/down through the list highlights its appearances in the tree with a different color. If item is currently selected AND highlighted it will have a unique color.
Help line when active:
(hj)up/down (Enter)Add to tree

Collected Serial Preview:
 - Not present if monitor never done.
 - Shows last preview (stored with preset)
 - Wraps
 - Logic: When collecting with monitor, identify a label line, identify a data-only line.
   - If labels not present for any fields, show auto-generated label line
   - If label line exists: Shows Label line
   - If data-only line exists: Shows Data line
